# Fabric Migration Assistant

The **Synapse Discovery Tool** is a migration assistant that helps you explore the configuration of Azure Synapse Analytics environments across one or more Azure subscriptions. 
It currently collects metadata for Synapse workspaces, notebooks, Spark pools, and Spark job definitions, and can export results in JSON for migrating to Fabric.
